# wxsEditor
This is GUI text editor with a refresh button. It was built with the WxWidgets GUI library. It was
specifically designed for editing WxWidgets XML files generated by the Code::Blocks IDE.
But of course, it is not limited to that. To compile and run, first become familiar with
this term: [DLL hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_Hell).

Good luck, you're going to need it.
